The purpose of this project is to implement UDP/IP and TCP/IP stacks using AVR ATMega microcontroler.  
During development there was utilized AVT-3505 evaluation board with ATMega162, 32kB RAM witch additional 
module board containing PHY/MAC ENC28J60.

Next goal is to implement tftp, dhcp, ftp, http application layers and implement FAT16 file system on SD card.


Features already available:

(+) - sending/receiving packets via enc28j60
(+) - handling ethernet packets
(+) - handling arp protocol, arp table which stores ip-mac pairs specified time
(+) - handling ip packets
(+) - icmp protocol - replying for echo requests
(+) - udp sockets
(+) - tftp - receiving file
